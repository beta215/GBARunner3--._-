This is a GBARunner3 fork which modifies color correction based on DS (NTR) screen's color profile, also turning down 'DISPLAY_GAMMA' a little bit.

The original version goes after simulating a GBA (AGB), but I find it too blue-ish and super bright. I'm happy with the fine-tuning I did here.

As always, your mileage may vary, since it depends a lot on how your screen looks. Clearly not intended for DS (NTR) consoles. :P

Have fun!
